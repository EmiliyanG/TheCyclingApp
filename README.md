# TheCyclingApp
This is a university dissertation project aimed to create android application focused entirely on cycling with embedded social network. 
Even though a big amount of work was done, the application is still under work. 
Each user can create account and use the application to track his/her cycling activity. Statistics for each cycling workout is pushed to a external 
server database via php files. Total and weekly statistics are also generated and can be viewed from profile activity.
